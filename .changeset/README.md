# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish.

## What are Changesets?

If you have made changes to this repo that should be published, run `pnpm changeset` to generate a changeset. A changeset is a markdown file that contains a description of your changes alongside a version bump type (major, minor, or patch).

## How to use changesets

1. Make your changes
2. Run `pnpm changeset` to create a changeset file describing your changes
3. Commit the changeset file
4. When ready to publish, run `pnpm changeset version` to update versions
5. Run `pnpm changeset publish` to publish packages
